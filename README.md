> The Agent is currently in **experimental** stage. It is not recommended to use it in production. Please forward all feedback to issues.

The agent using natural language instructions to browse web and extract data.

## How does Web Automation Agent work?

The Web Automation Agent is a tool that allows you to browse the web and extract data from websites using natural language instructions.
It uses large language models from [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/) to generate actions which should be performed.

The agent has access to a set of actions that can process:

* Go to URL
* Click on element
* Fill and submit form
* Extract data from the page
* Save data to output
* Save data to dataset
* Take and save screenshot

## How much does it cost?

The total cost for the agent usage is calculated based on costs for the LLMs and for the browser runtime.

## Cost of the OpenAI API
You can find the cost of the OpenAI API on the [OpenAI pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing).
The cost depends on the model you are using and the action browser process. The cost is calculated based on the number of tokens used.
You can see the cost in the log of the actor run.

## Cost of the running browser
The agent uses a headless browser running in Actor. The cost of the browser is based on the amount of time it takes to run the agent.
You can find information about the cost on the [pricing page](https://apify.com/pricing).
